# Raspberry Pi USB Gadget setup script

This script enables USB On-The-Go (OTG) functionality on a Raspberry Pi (currently tested and working up to Raspbian Bullseye). USB OTG enables the device to be plugged into a USB port, powered and directly accessed over IP from a host computer without any other network access.  

The script and code are based on an original blog post by [Ben Hardill](https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2019/11/02/pi4-usb-c-gadget/). There is some additional code to enable systemd functionality from the pre-built image scripts developed by [Tech Craft](https://github.com/techcraftco/rpi-usb-gadget/).

I created this script primarily for my own use, but if you found it helpful, you’re welcome ツ.
